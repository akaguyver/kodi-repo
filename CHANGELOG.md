# Sortovia (formerly Kodi Sorter) – version history

Newest first. Each line says what the update changed for you.

## 1.43 – Drive letter changes
- **1.43.0** **Drive letter changed? Fix the library**, in *Kodi library*. If your drive's letter changes, for example from E: to D:, Sortovia checks your files are on the new letter, saves a library backup for each letter, and points Kodi and Sortovia at the new one. Your shows, watched marks and resume points stay, and no videos are moved. Run it again whenever the letter changes.

## 1.42 – A new look
- **1.42.1** Sortovia's source code is now public at github.com/sortovia/sortovia, and bug reports go there too.
- **1.42.0** **Sortovia has its logo:** on its icon and Kodi backdrop, and in its full-window screens and web pages. Restart Kodi if the old icon still shows.

## 1.41 – YouTube test
- **1.41.0**
  - **Test YouTube without a phone**, in *Help & settings*. It checks whether this device could download from YouTube by itself, and downloads no videos.
  - **The guide now points to the right cookie extension,** cookies.txt 1.0, which is marked for Firefox on Android.

## 1.40 – Easier to read, more options
- **1.40.0**
  - **A full window for messages, and a guide that scrolls slowly by itself**, one line at a time, so you never lose your place. OK pauses, Up and Down move, and Left and Right change the speed. The guide is now split into topics.
  - **Send a problem report to the developer.** Sortovia removes private details from Kodi's log, shows you what's in it, and only uploads it if you agree.
  - **Protect saved passwords and keys with a passcode**, in Settings.
  - **New options in Settings:** sort videos under 50 MB instead of skipping them, and turn renaming movie titles to your language on or off.
  - **Your phone is now a download source,** with steps in the guide for the Android app, Termux and iPhone (experimental).
  - **xbox-share is now kodi-share,** because not everyone has an Xbox. The old command still works.
  - **New folder names:** `SortoviaLogs` and `SortoviaBackups` on the phone, and `_Sortovia temp` on your drive. Earlier logs and phone backups stay in their old folders.
  - Messages say your language instead of English.

## 1.39 – Sortovia
- **1.39.1** **The daily library backup is skipped when nothing has changed**, which saves time and space. *Back up now* always runs.
- **1.39.0**
  - **Sortovia is now called Sortovia.** Your folders, settings and updates carry on as before.
  - **Real-Debrid downloads by itself.** Anything you send to Real-Debrid downloads automatically once it's ready, in the background. If Kodi closes, it carries on the next time you open Sortovia.
  - **My releases.** Add the feed of your own uploads from any site you use, tick releases, and they go to Real-Debrid. No sites are built in.

## 1.38 – Ready for everyone
- **1.38.1** **Settings you can read.** The settings page showed blank labels on the Xbox, so *Help & settings → Settings* is now a plain list in Sortovia's own menu. Select a line to turn it on or off.
- **1.38.0**
  - **A settings page.** Open it from *Help & settings → Settings* or Kodi's *Configure* button. You can turn update checks, the daily library backup, the phone helper and log copying on or off, and set your TMDb key.
  - **The phone is now optional.** The welcome screen asks whether you want to use one, and answering No hides the phone and YouTube options.
  - **No more network searches for a phone you haven't set up.** Sortovia used to look for a phone every time it opened. Now it only looks after you've set one up or when you ask it to.
  - **Messages fit any device**, not just an Xbox, and mention the companion app.
  - **A new guide and web page**, with install steps, a troubleshooting section and a list of what Sortovia connects to. The add-on also has an icon and an MIT licence file.

## 1.37 – Your device, QR sign-in
- **1.37.3** **Copies from the phone are no longer thrown away as "size mismatch (0 vs …)".** When the phone's share was busy, the check of the original's size failed and came back as 0, so a good copy was deleted (the originals were always kept). The size is now asked again after the copy. The companion app's own cause is fixed in app 0.1.5.
- **1.37.2** **Picking a folder on the phone opens the phone's Download folder.** Kodi's folder browser can't open a place that isn't a Kodi source, so it showed the Xbox's list instead. Sortovia now lists the phone's folders itself: pick one to go into it, *Use this folder* to choose it, and Back to go up. This works with kodi-share and the companion app.
- **1.37.1** **An Xbox is detected as an Xbox** (1.37.0 said Windows PC). Kodi's system info on the Xbox only says Windows, so the device model is now read from the top of Kodi's log ("Running on Microsoft Xbox One S"), with the Xbox's network name as a backup check. If you confirmed Windows PC before, it asks once more.
- **1.37.0**
  - **Your device:** Sortovia detects what Kodi runs on (Xbox, Windows, Android, Raspberry Pi/Linux, Mac, Apple TV, LG TV) and asks you to confirm it once, on the welcome screen or at the next start. Steps are fitted to it.
    - New in *Help & settings*: **How to add your folders to Kodi** (on the Xbox, typing the `win-lib://` path; elsewhere, Browse) and **Your device**.
    - On an Xbox, moves don't try to rename first, which never works there.
  - **Real-Debrid sign-in shows a QR code.** Scan it with your phone's camera, and Real-Debrid opens for this sign-in, so you just tap Allow. The code to type at real-debrid.com/device is still shown. The QR code is drawn on the device itself, and nothing is sent to a website.
  - **Free up space** (was "on the Xbox") works on any device.
    - Kodi's own temporary folders are explained: add-on install leftovers, the scraper's cache.
    - The list title says which backup is the newest, and that it's kept.

## 1.36 – One menu entry, backups on the drive
- **1.36.0**
  - **Sortovia shows once in Program add-ons** again (1.34 and 1.35 showed it twice). Opening it still checks for updates and backs up the library first, at most once every 10 minutes.
  - **Library backups are saved on the library drive** (`_Kodi library backups`) and the phone only, not on the Xbox's own storage. Old ones on the Xbox are cleared after the next backup.
    - *Restore a backup* gets the one you pick ready in Kodi's Home folder, because Kodi's Import library can't see the external drive.
    - *Remove old library backups* frees space, always keeping the newest.
  - **Convert .cbr comics:** choose which ones (all are ticked to start). **Cancel stops after the comic being done**, and the menu then offers to carry on with the rest later. Turning pages also lets you choose the comics.

## 1.35 – Real-Debrid, and the Xbox's storage
- **1.35.0**
  - **Real-Debrid:** a new menu category.
    - Sign in with a code on your phone (real-debrid.com/device), then pick from *My torrents*, add a magnet link, unlock a file-host link, or get a recent download again.
    - Files download straight to `E:\Downloads\Real-Debrid` in the background, with progress and Stop at the top of the menu. Then *Sort the Real-Debrid downloads*.
  - **Big temporary files go on the library drive** (`E:\_Sortovia temp`), not the Xbox's own small storage. This covers building .cbz comics and the library backup's export, which also writes every poster and fan art.
    - Turning comic pages failed with "no space left on device" because of this.
  - **Free up space on the Xbox** (*Help & settings*) shows what's using the Xbox's storage and clears leftovers: temporary files, old add-on downloads and older backups. Kodi's artwork cache is shown but kept.
  - Shorter folder-picker titles, so they aren't cut off.

## 1.34 – A tidier menu
- **1.34.1** Fixes and a new clean-up:
  - **Converting .cbr to .cbz works on the Xbox.** The pages were read fine, but copying the finished .cbz onto the drive failed ("copying the .cbz failed"). It now copies through Kodi's own temp folder path.
  - **Clean TV library** (in *Kodi library*) removes episode entries that aren't TV episodes: files in Movies, Tutorials or a set-aside folder (`_Replaced`, `_Unpacked`, `_No English`), or ones also listed as movies. Then Kodi removes entries whose files are gone. Files are never deleted, and a backup is made first.
  - "Remove wrong movie entries" is now **Clean movie library**, and it also lets Kodi remove entries whose files are gone.
- **1.34.0** **The menu is now a Kodi folder list, sorted into categories**, like other add-ons: *Sort my downloads*, *YouTube*, *Tidy my library folders*, *Kodi library* and *Help & settings*. Each entry has a short description. Opening Sortovia still checks for updates and backs up the library first. A sort that's running, or one to resume, shows at the top.
  - **Pause YouTube downloads:** pause one download or all of them in *Downloads*, and carry on later from where they got to.
  - **Tidy my TV folder / Tidy my Movies folder:** puts what's already there into the folders and names Kodi expects. You see the full list first, and nothing is replaced without asking.

## 1.33 – Comics
- **1.33.1** **Remove wrong movie entries:** under *Kodi library* on the start menu. It finds movies that are really TV episodes, for example "Cesium Hollow" left behind after the whole drive was scanned as Movies. It shows the list and removes them all at once. Only the library entries are removed, never the files, and a library backup is made first. The start menu item is now called "Kodi library: back up, restore, remove wrong movies".
  - The Comics "tidy the folder" line no longer names Ironclad. It only ever moves what's out of place.
- **1.33.0** New start menu item: **Comics: tidy folders, convert .cbr to .cbz, turn pages**.
  - **Tidy the folder:** loose comics go into their series folder, and near-duplicate folders like "Ironclad (2)" are merged into "Ironclad". PDFs that an old version filed in Comics (bills, manuals) can be moved to a Documents folder. You see the list first.
  - **Convert .cbr to .cbz:** Kodi opens a .cbz by itself, page by page. A .cbr needs the Archive support add-on to unpack it first, which is slow and sometimes fails. The .cbr is deleted only after the new .cbz checks out. New .cbr comics are converted while sorting (you can turn this off).
  - **Turn pages for a monitor on its side:** each JPEG page gets an orientation tag, so Kodi shows it turned. Nothing is re-encoded, and "Upright" undoes it. Try one comic first.

## 1.32 – Library backup
- **1.32.0** **Back up / restore my Kodi library** on the start menu.
  - A backup holds Kodi's own library export (shows, episodes, movies, watched marks and resume points) plus a copy of Kodi's database file.
  - It's saved on the Xbox (Home folder → Kodi library backups), on your library drive (`_Kodi library backups`) and on the phone (`Download/KodiSorterBackups`). The newest 5 are kept on the Xbox and the drive.
  - It **backs up by itself once a day** when Sortovia opens, in the background. An empty library is never backed up, so a good backup is never pushed out.
  - If the library **suddenly loses half its episodes or movies**, for example after changing a source's content type, it warns you and shows how to put the backup back (Kodi: Settings → Media → Library → Import library).
  - **YouTube search** shows when each video came out and how many views it has. A new menu item, **Search results order**, sorts by best match, newest, most viewed, longest or shortest. Search is also quicker, because it asks YouTube directly.

## 1.31 – YouTube download quality
- **1.31.4** **Downloads and search results fit on screen.** Each entry has two short lines: the title, then its progress or its length and channel. Nothing scrolls, so pressing down moves to the next entry straight away. A failed download has **Show the whole error**.
  - Search asks YouTube for 20 results instead of 25, which saves one slow request. If the phone's internet is very slow, it says so plainly instead of showing a long command.
- **1.31.3** **Opens faster, with a start-up screen.** It shows "Starting... Checking for updates" straight away instead of nothing. The logs go to the phone in the background while it checks for updates, so it's ready a few seconds sooner. **Cancel** skips the update check, and a second click while it's opening is ignored.
- **1.31.2**
  - **Sorting YouTube downloads goes straight to your default folder.** You choose it once, and change it under "Where sorted videos go" in the YouTube menu. Before, it asked every time, because it ignored Xbox drive paths.
  - **No library rescan** when a run only moved tutorials or comics. They aren't in Kodi's library.
  - Titles in the Downloads list no longer show boxes, and "｜｜" becomes " - " instead of "--".
- **1.31.1** Better at YouTube titles:
  - "walkthrough", "webinar", "quick start" and "getting started" count as tutorials.
  - Producer Pal goes to Ableton Live, Claude Desktop to Claude, and "20⧸20" or "2020 software" to 2020 Design.
  - Emoji and the downloader's look-alike characters (⧸ ｜ ：), which show as boxes on the Xbox, are removed from file names.
  - The preview shows names without %20 codes, and a skipped YouTube video gives the real reason instead of "too small".
- **1.31.0** **Download quality** in the YouTube menu: best up to 4K, 1080p (the default), 720p, 480p, or sound only (.m4a). Lower quality makes smaller files and uses less mobile data. The setting is kept on the phone, and each queued video remembers the quality it was queued with.

## 1.30 – Your language
- **1.30.1** Fixes:
  - **Scans crashed** in 1.30.0 (a mistake in the movie-title lookup). Fixed, and a new test now loads every add-on file.
  - **Import cookies now** in the YouTube menu, with a plain message: imported, already have them, or no file found. A note also pops up whenever new cookies are picked up.
  - Downloads YouTube sends in pieces show progress (pieces done, MB) instead of 0%.
  - Hidden folders (like `.adblocker_1dm`) are skipped when scanning.
- **1.30.0** Choose **your language** on the welcome screen or under Help → Your language. You can pick one or use **Kodi's language**.
  - Sortovia keeps videos with audio in that language. Ones without go to `_No Spanish` and so on, or are skipped or deleted as you choose.
  - It keeps subtitles in that language, and names movies by their title in that language (TMDb).
  - Untagged audio tracks only count as English when English is your language.
  - The YouTube cookie guide now explains how to add an extension from its file when **Add to Firefox** is greyed out.

## 1.29 – Companion app ready
- **1.29.1** Fixes from the first run on the Xbox:
  - **Library folders** show where the standard folders are (for example `E:\Movies`).
  - **The guide** no longer breaks sentences across lines.
  - A folder whose videos are already in Kodi's library is no longer reported as "not a Kodi video source".
- **1.29.0** Sortovia also finds the phone when it runs the new **Sortovia companion** Android app instead of kodi-share in Termux.

## Phone setup
- **YouTube helper (Nov 3):** dropped connections ("Did not get any data blocks") retry by themselves, up to 3 times per video, keeping what was already downloaded. Pieces are retried 30 times before that.

- **One-step install for the phone (Nov 2026):** paste one line into Termux. Ubuntu isn't needed any more. It installs the Wi-Fi share, the YouTube downloader and the `kodi-share` command, and keeps the password from an older setup. See the README, section 3.

## 1.28 – Can Kodi read your folder?
- **1.28.1** **Search & download from YouTube** and **Help** are on the start menu from the very first run, so you don't need to sort something first.
- **1.28.0** When you pick an existing TV or Movies folder, Sortovia checks it against Kodi's library:
  - how many videos Kodi already has,
  - whether the folder is a video source with the right content type,
  - which files have names Kodi can't read.

  If anything's wrong, it explains how to fix it and offers to **reorganize the folder into Kodi-style folders**, in place. It shows how many files would move and roughly how long that takes, and the usual preview comes first. Safe choices are used: it asks before replacing anything, skips the audio check, leaves NFOs and subtitles alone, and doesn't change "Same as last time".

## 1.27 – Use your existing library folders
- **1.27.0** Each kind (TV, Movies, Comics, Tutorials) can go into **a folder you already have**, with any name on any drive. You choose them on the welcome screen or under Help → My library folders. Nothing already in them is moved.
  - New files reuse your **existing show, season and movie folders**: *Sams Sandwiches* → your *Sam's Sandwiches*, *Season 01* → your *Season 1*, *Matrix 1999* → your *The Matrix (1999)*.
  - Years must agree, so *Doctor Who (2005)* never lands in *Doctor Who (1963)*.

## 1.26 – Welcome screen and Help
- **1.26.0** First run shows a **welcome screen**:
  - Choose **what to sort** (TV, Movies, Comics, Tutorials). Kinds you leave unticked are skipped and listed in the preview.
  - It offers to show **the guide** (this README) on the TV.
  - New **Help** menu item: the guide, the version history and "what to sort".
  - After each update, a short **what's new** note.

## 1.25 – Download from YouTube
- **1.25.0** New menu item, **Download from YouTube**:
  - Search YouTube or type a link (a video or a playlist) on the Xbox. The phone downloads it into `Download/YouTube` (up to 1080p, in a format the Xbox plays).
  - Uses a `cookies.txt` exported from your signed-in browser.
  - The queue shows live progress. You can stop or retry a download, then sort the finished videos straight into your library.

## 1.23 – 1.24 – Tutorials
- **1.24.0** You can sort straight from a YouTube download folder (NewPipe, Seal and others). A video there that names a known program is filed as a tutorial even without the word "tutorial". Anything else in that folder is left alone instead of being guessed as a movie.
- **1.23.1** Tutorial folders for Ableton Live, Claude Code, OpenClaw and 20/20 Design.
- **1.23.0** Tutorials go to `Tutorials\<program>\` (AutoCAD, Revit, SketchUp, Blender …) with their original names. Short tutorial videos are no longer skipped as samples.

## 1.22 – Quality tags, credits clips, separate audio
- **1.22.4** A separate audio track is only brought along when the video has no English audio of its own.
- **1.22.3** Separate audio tracks (`.mka/.ac3/.eac3/.dts`) go next to their video, so Kodi offers them as an extra track.
- **1.22.2** Opening/ending credits clips with a show name go to Season 00 instead of being skipped.
- **1.22.1** Checks that `.nomedia` files were really written.
- **1.22.0** New NFO choice: movie `.nfo` files with **quality tags** (codec, 10-bit, source, bit rate).

## 1.21 – Cleaner leftovers, English titles
- **1.21.3** `.nomedia` in `_Unpacked`, `_Replaced` and `_No English`, so Kodi's library scan skips them.
- **1.21.2** Exact duplicates of library files and junk files are cleared. URL-style names (`%5b…`) are decoded. Every action is counted in the report.
- **1.21.1** English titles for Russian movie names written in Latin letters (e.g. *Bolshoi Gorod 3* → *Road Deputies 3*).
- **1.21.0** Option to remove empty folders from the source. It now says when movie titles weren't checked, and offers to set up the TMDb key.

## 1.20 – Subtitle languages
- **1.20.1** Shows progress for the steps after the scan (matching subtitles, checking the library).
- **1.20.0** Keep only the subtitle languages you choose. The others are deleted or parked.

## 1.19 – Destination folders
- **1.19.1** Much faster when moving many small files (subtitles).
- **1.19.0** The destination can be the Movies or TV folder itself. The other kinds go to the folders next to it.

## 1.18 – Comics and movie titles
- **1.18.0** Comics go into series folders. Movies named in another language get their English title (TMDb).

## 1.17 – Subtitles
- **1.17.0** Subtitles go to `Subs\` next to their video. Subtitles named only by language are matched to the right video. Release folders that were sorted earlier get tidied up.

## 1.15 – 1.16 – NFO files
- **1.16.1** Clearer warning when the destination is the Movies or TV folder.
- **1.16.0** Release `.nfo` files are used to tell a video's audio language when the file itself doesn't say.
- **1.15.0** Release NFOs become Kodi `.nfo` files (IMDb links). Leftovers are tidied and empty folders removed.

## 1.13 – 1.14 – Library tools
- **1.14.1** View any text or NFO file (old DOS art shows correctly).
- **1.14.0** **Where to watch**: per season, whether a show is on your services, free, or available to buy or rent (TMDb, free key).
- **1.13.0** **Find missing episodes** in your Kodi TV library (TVmaze). The report is saved to the phone.

## 1.12 – Phone and Xbox fixes
- **1.12.10** PDFs and EPUBs only count as comics inside a Comics or Manga folder (no more bills filed as comics).
- **1.12.9** Updates download as soon as they're released.
- **1.12.8** Sends the log when opened during a background move.
- **1.12.7** Guards against picking the TV folder as the destination. Files already in place are left alone.
- **1.12.6** Resume never deletes a finished copy.
- **1.12.5** Sort a drive in place (source = destination).
- **1.12.4** Finds the phone on the hotspot by itself.
- **1.12.3** Asks for the kodi-share password at start-up.
- **1.12.2** Choose **Stop now** or **Stop after this file**.
- **1.12.1** Works with the Xbox's drives, which can't rename files: copies go straight to the final name.
- **1.12.0** Kodi's logs are sent to the phone automatically.

## 1.9 – 1.11 – Background moves and the phone
- **1.11.1** Shows each step after a copy, so a hang can be traced.
- **1.11.0** Progress bar for each file (GB done, speed, time left). You can stop in the middle of a file.
- **1.10.0** Read downloads from the phone over Wi-Fi (kodi-share), or from a USB drive on the phone (FTP).
- **1.9.0** Moves run in the background while Kodi stays usable.

## 1.4 – 1.8 – Self-update, archives, resume
- **1.8.0** Full run report in Kodi's log.
- **1.7.x** OVAs and specials go to Season 00. Videos inside `.zip/.rar/.7z` are unpacked. An unfinished run can be resumed. The last settings are remembered. More reliable update checks. Clearer scan counts.
- **1.5.x** **Checks for updates** on every start and installs them. Notes are listed once per show. Textless openings are skipped.
- **1.4.0** "Scan finished" menu, scan progress, and scans that can be stopped and carried on.

## 1.0 – 1.3 – First versions
- **1.3.1** Version number shown in the dialog titles.
- **1.3.0** Fansub anime names (*Tinman Meadow*, *Paragon*) sort correctly. The add-on and the command-line tool share the same naming rules.
- **1.2.1** First Kodi add-on for the Xbox: TV, Movies and Comics with a preview, English-audio check and duplicate handling.
- Command-line `kodi_sort.py` with tests.
